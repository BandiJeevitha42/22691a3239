# React Frontend Design Document

## 1. Architectural Overview
- **Component-based architecture** using React functional components.
- **Separation of concerns**: UI, logic, and API calls are modularized.
- **Routing** handled by `react-router-dom` for SPA navigation.

## 2. Key Design Decisions
- **UI Library:** (e.g., Material-UI) for rapid, consistent, and responsive design.
- **State Management:** React Context for global state, local state for component-specific data.
- **API Layer:** All API calls are abstracted in `/services` with error handling and logging.
- **Logging Middleware:** Custom utility function used throughout for event/error logging.

## 3. Data Modeling & Persistence
- **User/session data** stored in `localStorage` for persistence across reloads.
- **API responses** cached in memory or localStorage as needed for performance.

## 4. Routing Strategy
- **Public routes:** Login, Register, Home, etc.
- **Protected routes:** Dashboard, Profile, etc. (redirect to login if not authenticated)
- **URL structure:** `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/profile`, etc.

## 5. Technology Choices & Justification
- **React:** Modern, component-based, large ecosystem.
- **Material-UI:** For rapid, accessible, and responsive UI.
- **Axios:** For promise-based HTTP requests.
- **React Router:** For SPA navigation.
- **React Context:** For scalable state handling.
- **Jest/RTL:** For reliable testing.

## 6. Error Handling
- All API calls wrapped in try/catch.
- User-friendly error messages displayed via UI.
- Logging middleware records all errors and significant events.

## 7. Assumptions
- User authentication is token-based.
- API endpoints are stable and follow REST conventions.
- The app will be deployed in a modern browser environment.
